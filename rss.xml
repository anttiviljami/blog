  }, &quot;C++&quot;)), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;The only way I could think of how to get started was to try and get my hands on any C++ books and often outdated documentation available in our local library.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;In hindsight this approach was obviously doomed from the beginning.

    parentName: &quot;p&quot;
  }, &quot;Hello World&quot;), &quot;, it turns out learning language features by writing console programs just isn\u2019t super helpful when your goal is to make the next hit PC game. Very quickly my younger self got demotivated by this approach. What\u2019s even worse, I don\u2019t think my friends were too impressed with the console programs I had written.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Luckily for me, my family got an internet connection in the early 00\u2019s and I soon found my way to a popular online community of kids learning to code games called &quot;, mdx(&quot;a&quot;, _extends({

This lead me to also learn web programming to build my own websites and simple server backends to add online functionality to the games I had built. I ended up starting my career in tech using those skills.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Looking back, I would\u2019ve been so much better off early on if someone had told me about the different available frameworks and tools I could\u2019ve used to build something resembling what I wanted to achieve. In my experience, learning a language usually comes as a side-effect of becoming productive rather than being a prerequisite.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Access to great resources, community, and good overall developer experience are the defining factor in getting productive quick.

Starting with a popular framework in the age of YouTube and online lectures, finding great (and free) online courses and tutorials shouldn\u2019t be an issue. &quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Learning different languages and paradigms, and especially learning about the quirks and features of your language of choice is definitely very useful and can make a huge difference to your productivity, but it\u2019s definitely not among the first things we should consider when helping someone get into programming.&quot;));
